	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="block1">Chicken</div><p>Okay, so here comes our framework, our responsive framework we're going to code up, it's going to be pretty simple but pretty effective as well. So, here first we define our row and all that is just saying that it's going to be 100% and wherever you put the row is, it's going to try to take up 100% of that space.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="block2">Beef</div><p>And then we're going to start having some media queries, so the first one is min width is 1200 pixels. Which means that if the display, the device display, is larger than 1200 pixels, all these styles will apply. And notice that what we're doing is we're defining these columns and we are marking them with lg for large and one, two, three, four and so on. And what we're saying is every single column they should float left, so, basically, we're going to have a float based layout.</p></div>
